        	<p>The Welcome Center, dedicated to telling the bridge's story, is the place where visitors can see authentic relics like hard hats and rivets from the Golden Gate Bridge's construction in the 1930s, watch a short orientation video, and check out the 12-foot "test tower" that was used in 1933 to evaluate the bridge's design. The Welcome Center has helpful staff that can share maps and answer questions. The center also offers a delightful souvenir selection, including bridge-themed postcards, framed posters, and jackets and hats for those who didn't know just how chilly a day over the bay can be. All proceeds benefit the parks, so you can feel great about bringing home a memento. Restrooms are nearby.The Golden Gate Bridge Welcome Center is open seven days a week from 9 am to 5 pm, except Thanksgiving and Christmas. Parking is very limited at the bridge, so public transportation is your best bet.</p>
